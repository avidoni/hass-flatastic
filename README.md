# 🏡 Home Assistant Flatastic Integration

This custom integration connects your [Flatastic](https://www.flatastic-app.com/) shared living group with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). 

It brings real-time data from Flatastic into Home Assistant and allows interaction with chores and the shopping list.
